## Abstract
Wearable robotics, particularly ankle exoskeletons, hold significant promise for advancing mobility, rehabilitation, and biomechanics research. However, their adoption in research is hindered by limited accessibility, high costs, and the proprietary nature of existing designs. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a fully open-source ankle exoskeleton platform, providing a customizable, and cost-effective tool for researchers. The design emphasizes accessibility through 3D-printable mechanical parts, compatibility with commercially available components, and detailed assembly instructions. Additionally, options for integrating diverse sensors such as force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) and inertial measurement units (IMUs) ensure adaptability to various experimental needs. By making this platform openly available, we aim to broaden access to wearable robotics technology, fostering innovation and supporting young scholars and underfunded institutions. This open-source design sets the stage for a new paradigm in collaborative research and development in assistive technologies, biomechanics, and beyond.
